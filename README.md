# PiCamera

### TODO
- turn on camera for 20 minutes after the motion is triggered.  
- use light sensor, add logic if it's light out, do not use the IR light
- move files from local to remote, keep the max that will fit on local
- log like a pro
- set max q to one and set the value with no wait to avoid error, add logic to only get value form q it q is not empty
